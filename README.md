# G20 Countries Analysis
Repository for my work on the analysis on the G20 nations.<br>
### Dataset: 
- The data for this analysis was taken from the World Bank website: https://data.worldbank.org/country/
- I have selected the countries which are a part of the G20 and downloaded `.csv` files containing information on various aspects such as economic and social.
### Tableau Dashboard:
- View the dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anitya.gangurde/viz/WorldwideCO2emissions_16402503766470/Story
### Data Wrangling and EDA:
- Used Pandas to clean the `.csv` files by dropping useless columns, tranposing the tables, renaming certain columns, removing null values and saving the modified versions to reuse again.
### ðŸ’¡Insights:
